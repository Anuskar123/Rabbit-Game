## Rabbit Run 
Rabbit Game is a browser-based maze game where the player controls a rabbit navigating through randomly generated mazes to collect points while avoiding enemies. The game supports infinite levels, with difficulty increasing over time.

## Features
- Infinite maze generation with guaranteed solvable paths.
- Randomized enemy and point placement each level.
- Increasing difficulty as levels progress.
- Player movement via arrow keys or WASD.
- Enemies move randomly within the maze.
- Score tracking across levels.

## Technologies Used
HTML for game structure and maze rendering, CSS for styling, layout, and animations, and JavaScript for game logic, maze generation, enemy AI, and score system.

## How to Play
Open the game in a web browser, use the Arrow Keys or WASD to move the rabbit, collect all points in the maze to unlock the next level, avoid enemies (touching them resets the game), and keep playing to achieve a high score.
